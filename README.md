# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Using the ride sharing data, we are creating a database that demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of ride sharing by the type of city (urban, suburban, rural). This will inform PyBer on how to have the edge in the ride sharing business.

## Results: 
The city types have wildly different results
  - In the rural cities, the total amount of drivers, fares and rides are minimal. The Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver, however, are high.
  - In the urban cities, the total amount of drivers, fares and rides are high. The Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver, however, are low.
  - In suburban cities, the data is right in between the rural and urban figures.

Using a multi-line chart, we can see that the highest total fares for the rural cities don't ever match lowest numbers for the suburban cities. The highest total fares for suburban cities don't ever match the lowest numbers for urban cities

## Summary: 
To expand PyBer's ride sharing program, I would make to following suggestions:

  - The average fare per driver is much higher in rural and suburban areas. This could be used to entice drivers to branch out to those areas. And with more drivers, the fares could be lowered by a small amount, making it more affordable for riders in those areas.
  - The huge number of rides in urban cities would indicate the demand is high. Increasing rates by a small amount would go a long way to increase profits and give more money to the drivers. This would help driver retention.
  - To synergize efforts, there could be a push for commute ride sharing. For example, a rider who lives in a suburban city, but works in a urban city. This would get drivers in suburban cities to take a fare into an urban city. They would then be able to get fares in an urban city for the day. At commute time, they would then get the rider back into the suburban areas. This could be a subscription service to cut down the total cost for the rider but would incentivize the drivers since they would make more while in the urban city.
